== Receiving Kafka Records

The Kafka Connector retrieves Kafka Records from Kafka Brokers and maps each of them to Reactive Messaging `Messages`.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have a Kafka broker running, and accessible using the `kafka:9092` address (by default it would use `localhost:9092`).
Configure your application to receive Kafka records from a Kafka _topic_ on the `prices` channel as follows:

[source]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092      # <1>

mp.messaging.incoming.prices.connector=smallrye-kafka       # <2>
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.DoubleDeserializer    # <3>
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.broadcast=true     # <4>
----
1. Configure the broker location. You can configure it globally or per channel
2. Configure the connector to manage the `prices` channel
3. Sets the (Kafka) deserializer to read the record's value
4. Make sure that we can receive from more that one consumer (see `KafkaPriceConsumer` and `KafkaPriceMessageConsumer` below) 

NOTE: You don't need to set the Kafka topic. By default, it uses the channel name (`prices`). You can configure the `topic` attribute to override it.

Then, your application receives `Message<Double>`.
You can consumes the payload directly:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/KafkaPriceConsumer.java[]
----

Or, you can retrieve the `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/KafkaPriceMessageConsumer.java[]
----

=== Deserialization

The deserialization is handled by the underlying Kafka Client.
You need to configure the:

* `mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].value.deserializer` to configure the value deserializer (mandatory)
* `mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].key.deserializer` to configure the key deserializer (optional, default to `String`)

If you want to use a custom deserializer, add it to your `CLASSPATH` and configure the associate attribute.

=== Inbound Metadata

Messages coming from Kafka contains an instance of {javadoc-base}/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata.html[IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata<K, T>] in the metadata.
`K` is the type of the record's key.
`T` is the type of the record's value.
It provides the key, topic, partitions, headers and so on:

[source, java]

include::example$inbound/KafkaMetadataExample.java[]

=== Acknowledgement

Acknowledging a message coming from Kafka commit the offset.
Refer to the Kafka documentation for details.

IMPORTANT: To let the connector handles the offset commit, you must set the `enable.auto.commit` attribute to `false`.

=== Failure Management

If a message produced from a Kafka record is _nacked_, a failure strategy is applied.
The Kafka connector supports 3 strategies:

* `fail` - fail the application, no more records will be processed. (default)
The offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is not committed.
* `ignore` - the failure is logged, but the processing continue.
The offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is committed.
* `dead-letter-queue` - the offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is committed, but the record is written to a (Kafka) _dead letter topic_.

The strategy is selected using the `failure-strategy` attribute.

In the case of `dead-letter-queue`, you can configure the following attributes:

* `dead-letter-queue.topic`: the topic to use to write the records not processed correctly, default is `dead-letter-topic-$channel`, with `$channel` being the name of the channel.
* `dead-letter-queue.key.serializer`: the serializer used to write the record key on the dead letter queue. By default, it deduces the serializer from the key deserializer.
* `dead-letter-queue.value.serializer`: the serializer used to write the record value on the dead letter queue. By default, it deduces the serializer from the value deserializer.

The record written on the dead letter queue contains the `dead-letter-reason` header with the nack reason (message from the exception passed to the `nack` method).
It may also contain the `dead-letter-cause` with the message from the cause, if any.
