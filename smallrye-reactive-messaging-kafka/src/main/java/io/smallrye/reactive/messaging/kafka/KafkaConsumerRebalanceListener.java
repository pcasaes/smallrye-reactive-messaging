 *
 *
 * To configure which listener you want to use, set the name in the inbound connector's consumer re-balance listener attribute,
 * ex:
 * {@code
 *  mp.messaging.incoming.example.consumer-rebalance- listener.name=ExampleConsumerRebalanceListener
 * }
 * {@code @Named("ExampleConsumerRebalanceListener")}
 *
 * Alternatively, name your listener (using the {@code @Named} annotation) to be the group id used by the connector, ex:
 * {@code
 *  mp.messaging.incoming.example.group.id=my-group
 * }
 * {@code @Named("my-group")}
 *
 * Setting the consumer re-balance listener name takes precedence over using the group id.
